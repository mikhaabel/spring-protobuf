### Google Protocol Buffers in Spring Boot

During this talk I will show how to config, develop and run Spring Boot application's REST API with Protocol Buffers as a client response. There will be four steps:

1. Generate Spring boot application and setup Maven dependencies
2. Create .proto structure
3. Develop controller and repository with mock data
4. Create integration test with rest template and http client 

Back-end will be REST API, built on Spring. Protocol Buffers technology is used with respective Maven's plugins to compile .proto structures into Java models.
